  PROPKA is now used with ``--ph-calc-method=propka --with-ph`` now defaults to 7.0 and is only required if a different pH value is required.

* ``--ph-calc-method`` to select optional method to calculate pH values used to protonate titratable residues.
  Possible options are "propka" and "pdb2pka".

* Merged PDB2PKA code, PDB2PKA is functional now.

* Added two new options: ``--neutraln`` and ``--neutralc``, so that users can manually make the N-termini or C-termini of their proteins neutral.

* Added a ``local-test``, which addresses the issue of Debian-like Linux distros not allowing fetching PDBs from the web.

* Added deprotonated Arginine form for post-PROPKA routines.
  This only works for PARSE forcefield as other forcefields lack deprotonated ARG parameters.

Fixes
=====

* Verbosity outputs should be stdouts, not stderrs in web server interface.
  Corrected this in :file:`src/routines.py`.

* Fixed a bug in :file:`psize.py`: for a pqr file with no ATOM entries but only HETATM entries in it, :file:`inputgen.py` should still create an APBS input file with reasonable grid lengths.

* Added special handling for special mol2 formats (unwanted white spaces or blank lines in ATOM or BOND records).

* Added template file to doc directory, which fixed a broken link in  programmer guide.

Changes
=======

* Updated structures.py, now PDB2PQR keeps the insertion codes from PDB files.

* Updated NBCR opal service urls from http://ws.nbcr.net/opal/... to http://ws.nbcr.net/opal2/...

* Compressed APBS OpenDX output files in zip format, so that users can download zip files from the web server.

* Updated pydoc by running :file:`genpydoc.sh`.

* Updated CHARMM.DAT with two sets of phosphoserine parameters.

* Allowed amino acid chains with only one residue, using ``--assign-only`` option.

* Updated :file:`server.py.in` so that the ligand option is also recorded in :file:`usage.txt`.

* Updated HE21, HE22 coordinates in GLN according to the results from AMBER Leap program.

* Updated :file:`Makefile.am` with Manuel Prinz's patch (removed distclean2 and appended its contents to distclean-local).

* Updated :file:`configure.ac`, :file:`pdb2pqr-opal.py`; added :file:`AppService_client.py` and :file:`AppService_types.py` with Samir Unni's changes, which fixed earlier problems in invoking Opal services.

* Applied two patches from Manuel Prinz to :file:`pdb2pka/pMC_mult.h` and :file:`pdb2pka/ligand_topology.py`.

* Updated :file:`PARSE.DAT:file:` with the source of parameters.

* Created a :file:`contrib` folder with :mod:`numpy-1.1.0` package.
  PDB2PQR will install numpy by default unless any of the following conditions is met:

  * Working version of NumPy dectected by autoconf.
  * User requests no installation with ``--disable-pdb2pka`` option.
  * User specifies external NumPy installation

* Merged Samir Unni's branch.
  Now PDB2PQR Opal and APBS Opal services are available (through ``--with-opal`` and/or ``--with-apbs``, ``--with-apbs-opal`` options at configure stage).

* Added error handling for residue name longer than 4 characters.

* Updated :file:`hbond.py` with Mike Bradley's definitions for ANGLE_CUTOFF and DIST_CUTOFF by default.

* Removed PyXML-0.8.4, which is not required for ZSI installation.

* Updated propka error message for make adv-test -- propka requires a version of Fortran compiler.

* Updated :file:`na.py` and :file:`PATCHES.xml` so that PDB2PQR handles three lettered RNA residue names (ADE, CYT, GUA, THY, and URA) as well.

* Updated NA.xml with HO2' added as an alternative name for H2'', and H5" added as an alternative name for H5''.

* Updated version numbers in html/ and doc/pydoc/ .

***************
1.3.0 (2008-01)
***************

Additions
=========

* Added ``make test`` and ``make adv-test``

* Added integration with Opal for launching jobs as well as querying status

Fixes
=====

* Fixed the line feed bug.
  Now PDB2PQR handles different input files (:file:`.pdb` and file:`.mol2`) created or saved on different platforms.

* Fixed ``hbondwhatif`` warning at start up.

* Fixed problems with ``make dist``

* The default value of 7.00 for the pH on the server form is removed due to a problem with browser refershing.

Changes
=======

* The user may use NUMPY to specify the location of NUMPY.

* Both PDB2PKA and PROPKA are enabled by default.
  PDB2PKA is enabled by default since ligand parameterization would fail without this option.

* For a regular user, ``make install`` tells the user the exact command the system administrator will use to make the URL viewable.

* Updated warning messages for lines beginning with SITE, TURN, SSBOND and LINK.

* Switched license from GPL to BSD.

* Made a new tar ball :file:`pdb2pqr-1.3.0-1.tar.gz` for Windows users who cannot create file:`pdb2pqr.py` through configure process.

* file:`configure` now automatically detects SRCPATH, WEBSITE, and the location of file:`pdb2pqr.cgi`.
  In version 1.2.1, LOCALPATH(SRCPATH) and WEBSITE were defined in file:`src/server.py` and the location of file:`pdb2pqr.cgi` was specified in file:`html/server.html` (file:`index.html`).
  Configure now uses variable substitution with new files file:`src/server.py.in` and file:`html/server.html.in` to create file:`src/server.py` and file:`html/server.html` (file:`index.html`).

* :makevar:`SRCPATH` is automatically set to the current working directory.
  :makevar:`WEBSITE` is automatically set to http://fully_qualified_domain_name/pdb2pqr.
  Path to CGI is automcailly set to http://fully_qualified_domain_name/pdb2pqr/pdb2pqr.cgi.

* In version 1.2.1, there were 3 variables that needed to be changed to set up a server at a location different from agave.wustl.edu.
  :makevar:`LOCALPATH`, :makevar:`WEBSITE`, and the location of the CGI file.
  In this version, :makevar:`LOCALPATH` has been used to :makevar:`SRCPATH` to avoid confusion, since :makevar:`LOCALPATH` could be interpreted as the local path for source files or the localpath for the server.

* Since configure now automatically sets the locations of files/directories based on the machine and configure options, the default  agave.wustl.edu locations are not used anymore.

* A copy of :file:`pdb2pqr.css` is included.

* :file:`configure` prints out information about parameters such as python flags, srcpath, localpath, website, etc.

* :file:`configure` now automatically creates tmp/ with r + w + x permissions.

* :file:`configure` now automatically copies :file:`pdb2pqr.py` to :file:`pdb2pqr.cgi`.

* :file:`configure` now automatically copies :file:`html/server.html` to :file:`index.html` after variable substitution.
  In :file:`src/server.py.in` (:file:`src/server.py`), :makevar:`WEBNAME` is changed to :file:`index.html`.

* :file:`${HOME}/pdb2pqr` is the default prefix for a regular user

* :file:`/var/www/html` is the default prefix for root

* http://FQDN/pdb2pqr as default website.

* ``make install`` runs ``make`` first, and the copies the approprite files to ``--prefix``.

* If root did not specify ``--prefix`` and :file:`/var/www/html/pdb2pqr` already exists, then a warning is issued, and the user may choose to quit or overwrite that directory.

* Similary, if a regular user did not specify ``--prefix`` and :file:`${HOME}/pdb2pqr` already exists, then a warning is issued, and the user may choose to quit or overwrite that directory.

* If root does not specify ``--prefix`` to be a directory to be inside :file:`/var/www/html` (for example, ``--prefix=/share/apps/pdb2pqr``), then a symbolic link will be made to :file:`/var/www/html/pdb2pqr` during ``make install``.

* :file:`configure` option ``--with-url`` can be specified either as something like http://sandstone.ucsd.edu/pdb2pqr-test or sandstone.ucsd.edu/pdb2pqr-test.
  It also doesn't matter if there's a '/' at the end.

* If user is root, and the last part of URL and prefix are different, for example, ``--with-url=athena.nbcr.net/test0 --prefix=/var/www/html/pdb2pqr-test``, then a warning will be issued saying the server will be viewable from the URL specified, but not the URL based on pdb2pqr-test.
  In other words, the server will be viewable from athena.abcr.net/test0, but not athena.nbcr.net/pdb2pqr-test.
  During ``make  install``, a symbolic link is created to enable users to view the server from ``--with-url``.

* When making a symbolic link for root, if then link destination already exists as a directory or a symoblic link, then the user may choose to continue with creating the link and overwrite the original directory or quit.

* If the user changes :makevar:`py_path` when running configure for PDB2PQR, then the change also applies to PROPKA.

Known issues
============

* The install directory name cannot contain dots.

* For python 2.2, if PDB2PQR cannot find module :mod:`sets`, then :mod:`sets` needs to be copied from :file:`.../python2.2/site-packages/MYSQLdb/sets.py` to :file:`.../lib/python2.2`

***************

* Fixed a bug where chains were improperly detected when only containing one HETATM residue (thanks to Reut Abramovich)

***************
1.1.1 (2006-05)
***************

Fixes
=====

***************

Additions
=========

* Added an :file:`extensions` directory for small scripts.
  Scripts in this directory will be automatically loaded into PDB2PQR has command line options for post-processing, and can be easily customized.

* Pydoc documentation is now included in :file:`html/pydoc`.

* A programmer's guide has been included to explain programming decisions and ease future development.

* A ``--ffout`` flag has been added to allow users to output a PQR file in the naming scheme of the desired forcefield.

Fixes
=====
* Updated :file:`psize.py` to use centers and radii when calculating grid sizes (thanks to John Mongan)

* Fixed bug where PDB2PQR could not read PropKa results from chains with more than 1000 residues (thanks to Michael Widmann)


Changes
=======

* Structural data files have been moved to XML format.
  This should make it easier for users and developers to contribute to the project.

* Code has been greatly cleaned so as to minimize values hard-coded into functions and to allow greater customizability via external XML files.
  This includes a more object-oriented hierarchy of structures.

* Improved detection of the termini of chains.

* Assign-only now does just that - only assigns parameters to atoms without additions, debumping, or optimizations.

* Added a ``--clean`` command line option which does no additions, optimizations, or forcefield assignment, but simply aligns the PDB columns on output.
  Useful for using post-processing scripts like those in the extensions directory without modifying the original input file.

* The ``--userff`` flag has been replaced by opening up the ``--ff`` option to user-defined files.

* User guide FAQ updated.

* The efficiency of the hydrogen bonding detection script (``--hbond``) has been greatly improved.

* Increased the number of options available to users via the PDB2PQR web server.

***************
1.0.2 (2005-12)
***************
