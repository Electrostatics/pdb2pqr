## Note

This is not originally written code, it is simply a few of the scripts in the pKa-ANI repository found here: https://github.com/isayevlab/pKa-ANI. I had to write it this way (instead of simply importing the repo as a python package) because the package is not
exportable as a python package, only downloadable via conda. I did not want to bother with making the pdb2pqr user set up a conda
environment just for this one feature.


If you use pKa-ANI to assign titration states, please cite the paper in which they published the method:
